> **The ultimate VS Code extension that reacts to your code with sound — screams when things go wrong, celebrates when they go right.**
> Terminal failures, red squiggles, broken saves, failed builds, crashed debuggers — nothing escapes the scream. Successful commands get a victory sound. Fully customizable with per-sound settings, funny toasts, escalation mode, waveform viewer, DND schedule, and more.

## 📖 User Manual

### ⚡ Trigger 1: Terminal Failure *(always on)*

The core trigger. Every time a terminal command exits with a non-zero code, it screams.

**Example:**
1. Open the integrated terminal
2. Run `ls nonexistent` or `exit 1`
3. 🔊 SCREAM!

> Also supports **error pattern detection** — scan terminal output for keywords like `Error:`, `Traceback`, etc. even when exit code is 0. Enable via `errorScreamer.errorPatternDetectionEnabled`.

---

### 🔴 Trigger 2: Diagnostic Errors *(live, while typing)*

Watches your code in real-time. The moment a **new** Error-severity diagnostic (red squiggle) appears, it screams. Uses a 150ms debounce to avoid spam while typing, and resets its baseline when you switch files.

**Example:**
1. Open any `.js`, `.ts`, `.py` file
2. Type something broken like `const = ;`
3. The moment VS Code shows the red squiggle → 🔊 SCREAM!

> Only screams when errors **increase**. Fixing errors does not trigger it.

**To turn off:** Set `errorScreamer.playOnDiagnostics` to `false`.

---

### 💾 Trigger 3: Save & Scream

Every time you press `Ctrl+S`, it checks if the saved file still has Error-severity diagnostics. If it does — scream.

**Example:**
1. Have a file open with red squiggles
2. Press `Ctrl+S`
3. 🔊 Caught!

**To turn off:** Set `errorScreamer.playOnSave` to `false`.

---

### 🛑 Trigger 4: Task Failure

When a VS Code Task (build scripts, test suites, etc.) exits with a non-zero code, it screams.

**How to trigger:**
1. `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Run Build Task) or `Terminal → Run Task`
2. If the task fails → 🔊 SCREAM!

**To turn off:** Set `errorScreamer.playOnTaskFailure` to `false`.

---

### 🐛 Trigger 5: Debug Session Crash

When a debug session terminates (crash, exception, stopped), it screams.

**How to test:**
1. Create `test.py` with `1/0`
2. Press `F5` to debug
3. Python crashes with `ZeroDivisionError` → 🔊 SCREAM!

**To turn off:** Set `errorScreamer.playOnDebuggerCrash` to `false`.

---

### 😱 Funny Toast Messages

When `showErrorToast` and `funnyToasts` are both enabled, each scream shows a random hilarious roast:

| | |
|---|---|
| 😱 AAAHHHHHH! You broke it again! | 💀 RIP your code. Rest in errors. |
| 🚨 ERROR DETECTED. INITIATING SCREAM PROTOCOL. | 🤦 Have you tried turning your brain off and on again? |
| 🔥 Your code just burst into flames! | 🫠 The code is melting... MELTING! |
| 📢 ATTENTION: Your code has committed a crime! | 😂 It's not a bug, it's a ✨ feature ✨ |
| 🧨 KABOOM! Another error explosion! | ☠️ Your code just ragequit. |

...and more! (15 total)

---

### 🔥 Escalation Mode

The more you mess up, the louder and faster it gets.

1. Enable `errorScreamer.escalationEnabled`
2. Set a threshold (default: 3 consecutive errors)
3. Each tier above threshold adds volume boost + speed boost
4. Status bar shows `$(flame) Escalation tier N!`

---

### 🌙 Do Not Disturb

Don't want screams during a late-night meeting?

1. Enable `errorScreamer.doNotDisturbEnabled`
2. Set start/end times (e.g. `23:00` → `08:00`)
3. Sounds are silently suppressed during those hours
4. Handles overnight windows correctly

---

### 🔇 Quick Enable / Disable

1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Error & Success Reactor: Toggle On/Off** — master switch
2. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Error & Success Reactor: Quick Mute** — mutes sounds, but streak/stats still track

---

### 🎵 Custom Sounds

1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Error & Success Reactor: Import Sound File** — opens a file picker for `.mp3` and asks which category (Error or Success)
2. Or drop any `.mp3` into `sounds/errors/` or `sounds/success/` — it appears automatically
3. Use **Error & Success Reactor: Select Error Sound** to set the active error sound
4. Each sound has its own **Volume / Speed / Pitch / Reverse / Label** — all configurable in the Settings panel

**Folder structure:**
```
sounds/
  errors/        ← error sounds (.mp3)
    aahh.mp3
    fahhhh.mp3
    ...
  success/       ← success sounds (.mp3)
    mission-passed.mp3
    ...
```

---

### 📊 Stats & Counters

- **Status bar** (bottom-right) — shows current streak, mute state, escalation tier
- **Daily stats** — error count per day (last 7 days in the Settings panel)
- **Lifetime scream counter** — persistent across sessions, shown in Settings panel stats
- Click the status bar item to view today's stats
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Reset Lifetime Scream Counter** to start fresh

## 🔧 How It Works

Error & Success Reactor hooks into **five** VS Code native APIs simultaneously:

| # | API | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `vscode.window.onDidEndTerminalShellExecution` | Terminal command finishes (exit code + pattern matching) |
| 2 | `vscode.languages.onDidChangeDiagnostics` | Red squiggles increase while typing (150ms debounce + delta check) |
| 3 | `vscode.workspace.onDidSaveTextDocument` | File saved with errors |
| 4 | `vscode.tasks.onDidEndTaskProcess` | VS Code task exits non-zero |
| 5 | `vscode.debug.onDidTerminateDebugSession` | Debug session terminates |

All triggers route through a shared guard chain: **enabled → muted → DND → cooldown → play → toast → escalation → stats**.

**Playback pipeline:**
1. **Fast path** — `sound-play` npm (~50ms, no shell spawn) for normal playback
2. **Slow path** — platform-specific shell commands with ffmpeg for speed/pitch/reverse

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
npm test          # 130 unit tests
npm run lint      # ESLint
```

Tests cover: pattern matching, audio filter chains, platform command builders, atempo decomposition, toast pool validation, category-aware sound discovery, and more.

---

## 📦 Packaging

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
vsce package --out builds/
```

VSIX is ~360 KB (17 files) — only `sound-play` is bundled, devDependencies are excluded.
